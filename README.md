Express Cars and Cats

Have localhost:8000/cars.html go to a simple HTML page that shows some cool pictures of different cars.  These car pictures should be stored in your static directory.  DON'T just link to pictures of cars stored somewhere else! Even better, put them in a directory called 'images' inside of your static directory

Have localhost:8000/cats.html show a simple HTML page with some cool pictures of cats.  Again, make sure these pictures are stored on your server.

Have localhost:8000/form.html show a simple form where the user can add new car information. For this page, there is no need to have the form do anything. Simply display the form there.

Also, add a basic html file in your static directory called index.html. What happens when you navigate to the root route localhost:8000?
